# Outline

1. Objectives
   1. **Explore** the fundamental scaling laws of digital pressure vessels. 
      1. Discussion of digital pressure vessel geometries and quasi-isotropicity
   2. **Design** a succession of vehicles capable of housing 10 to 10000 humans
      1. illustrate the process of growth/incorporation in a cycler system
      2. show the succession of morphologies for the cycler vehicle
         1. Chart showing mass over time? 
   3. **Examine** the logistics of constructing this series of vehicles on a cycler trajectory
      1. choosing a trajectory
      2. taxi vehicle design
      3. necessary infrastructure
2. Mission Context
   1. A Mars mission where the goal is to produce infrastructure **as a result** of the mission, and not as the goal of the mission itself. 
   2. What is the impact of component recycling on the mass of the system?
